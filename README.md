# My code notes
Just my notes for languages like:
* c++

There will probably never be added any other languages.

To get the full experience use a free application called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It is on pacman for arch users *(also on snap if you're not)*. Windows and mac is also supported.

Obsidian is also really good so consider using it yourself.
