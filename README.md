# My code notes
Just my notes for the languages that i think needs notes.
at the moment this includes:
* c++

there will probably never be added any other languages.

To get the full experience use an application called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It is on pacman for arch users *(also on snap if you dont)*. Windows and mac is also supported.
